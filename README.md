Team 2: Saikumar Baddam, Elizabeth Cardosa, Ebony Cross-Williams

## Project Introduction
@Sai

## Background 
@Sai

## Datasets
@Sai

## Models

## Conclusions 

# Future Work: 

## Target User(s)
* Senators/Campaign managers​
  * Identify performance at a given point in time to influence voting decisions, public persona, and engagement​

* Tailor campaign strategies based on predicted approval ratings​
  * Use localized feature importances to understand impacts of demographic and voting behavior on job approval rating​
  
* Voters​
  * Model Senators approval ratings in the future to help identify optimal candidate to vote for

## Deployment 
* User Interface – Intuitive way to interact with and glean insights from model inferences​
  * Visualizations​
  * Explanations​

* Model Retraining - Whenever new polling data comes out retrain model with updated data set​
  * Scheduled vs. Automatic based on available data​
  * Complete retraining vs. Fine-tuning​
  
* DevOps/MLOps – Establish infrastructure to automatically deploy and update project​
  * Continuous model integration​
  * Monitoring of model performance 

## Other
* Train project-specific emotion classifier/valence regressor
  * <TODO>

* Curate more data
  * Gather more senator images
  * Obtain JARs over longer period of time, representing more senators as well

* World Events effects on JARs
  * Perform analysis of global events, such as COVID-19, wars, economic crisis on JARs and if there are any trends that arrise that could be used to predict future JARs during world events.

* Clustering Analysis
  * Perform clustering to see if natural trends arise in the senator datasets such as relationships between demographic data, persona characeteristics, party, etc.
